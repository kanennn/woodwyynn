hi guys i'm not dead

i miss the days of the old internet.

back when everyone's content was not spoon fed by an algorithm, and people just browsed silly little sites made by their friends. it was a good time.

i wish the internet now could be like that.

i honestly don't know how to bring it back to that but i am going to start thinking about how to bring back that ethos of decentralized local style internet

it's very similar to the issue of communication moving from deep in person interaction with a few local friends to an excess online interaction with many different people. don't get me wrong this has wonderful benefits, but has lead to many interactions feeling a little shallow, just like the modern internet

food for though
love for you all<3 

peace✌️
