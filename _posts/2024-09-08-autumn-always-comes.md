this morning i was thinking about how the world around us is really beautiful.

sometimes it's hard to see. but every now and then i can. it's like a moment of "you know life is pretty good."

every now and then God seems to give us a glimpse of heaven, and i feel a deep sense of peace, joy, and gratitude. i mourn sometimes that i do not always feel that presence, but just having a single ray of hope and a single second of peaceful joy has gotten me through many hard times.

it's beginning to feel like autumn. i can feel it in the air. the smells change, the temperatures change, the way a breath feels in your lungs is a bit different. the sound of rain soaking the soil soothes my soul, and the hearty breeze warms my heart. i feel a sense of peace and anticipation of my favorite season, autumn.

with any hardship in life, any sense of pain, any deep despair, there is an end to that tunnel. sometimes the summer sun strikes so hard, and the dry air drives what once was green life to the brink of death. but autumn always comes.

sometimes it's just that one breeze, that one drop of rain, that one glimpse of heaven that can turn our heads up from the dust and light a fire in our soul again.

whatever drought you find yourself in, i hope that breeze finds you, and that drop of rain comes quickly.
no matter how dry it is, how dreary life looks, have hope, and remember that autumn always comes.
