sorry for the depressing subtitle ðŸ˜­

i've heard often that people regret lacking to love and be kind to others later in life. many of us take for granted the friends we have around us. we pretend like we're all invincible, and that these people will never go away.

you've probably heard advice like this before: like cherish life because it's short. but if you're like me, you probably appreciated the advice for about 30 seconds and went on with your life, without taking it seriously. 

i thought it sweet but over dramatic sometimes, unnecessary, or just not applicable to my life. sure yes we'll all die someday, but not today, so i don't have to go to the effort today.

i have lost friends though, that i never expected to lose

so cherish your friends, and let them know that you love them, right now
