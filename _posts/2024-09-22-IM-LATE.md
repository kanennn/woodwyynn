_(what i did in the last three hours because i don't know what to write)_

i made an inspirational video about how the internet is sucking our attention because there are endless possibilities and that stresses out our brains bc we can't comprehend endless information and content

and how we should touch more grass and not be consumers

and then i started watching youtube shorts :3
