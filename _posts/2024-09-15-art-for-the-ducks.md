# let's experience how writing goes in real time

i struggle a lot with making art when there's nobody there to appreciate it.

this site has actually been one of my most successful streaks of creativity, and it's only been going for a month and a half. i'm not sure if anyone is even seeing anything i write, but somehow i've kept going.

...

**Duck enters the room**

duck is our friend. duck helps us overcome creative struggles.

when talking about problem solving, communication practicing, i've heard suggestions before like "talk to a wall" or "explain the problem to your pet rock."

well, how about making art for your rubber duck?

this is how i've gotten so far in my writing. i do realize i may be writing to myself, but in my head there's this character that is somehow reading my writing on the other side of my website.

maybe i have some urge to just make the content and put the words there. all these ideas are already in my head, i just want them to be in a readable form, out there, so my online rubber duck friend can read and benefit from them.

another part is honestly for myself. i want to document my thoughts, publicly, where i can show them off if need be. there's sort of this charm i've realized, of posting online where no one sees, but someone could see.

this isn't a fully fleshed out thought, and maybe there are other reasons in my head why i don't like posting for nobody to see, and some other way i've tangled my brain around to do it anyways.

TLDR make art to show to your rubber duck

# nevermind one sec

_that was what i was originally gonna post, but then i realized this is not at all how my brain works_

i've been thinking about how i would show my writing or art to a rubber duck

i actually definitely would not, i would immediately think, "this duck is inanimate and i'm wasting my time 1000%, i'm basically just talking to myself about my own stuff in a useless manner"

so this is a better way of describing how the hell i've got out of my creative worthlessness rut:

it's like graffiti

_(bear with me lol)_

i don't make content for an imaginary character. i don't make content for an imaginary audience. i don't make content for a real audience (i don't rly have one yet). i don't make content for myself.

i make content to be out there. i make art and post it so i can sit back and look at it all and say, "look at all that great content, my content, that's just out there. i don't know if anyone will see it, but i've created beautiful things, and they're just, there."

i suppose it's like the same feeling as spray-painting a wall in an alleyway or on a train

it's different than painting something in your room, but not the same as putting art in a museum.

you finish painting and just look at it, like, wow this is sick, it's out there, no one may care, lots of people may care, i don't care. it just feels good to step back and be able to see my art, and know other people can see it too"

# actually scratch that, that also feels off

it's kinda just like painting your house a new color, or putting art on your walls, or decorating your bedroom, writing a story for your friend, drawing commissions, uploading family videos to youtube, starting a school newspaper, attaching a perler-bead dongle to your backpack, wearing a fun, artsy, eccentric outfit in public

it's kinda just like making art

it's kinda all that

hopefully that gets my point across lol

have a beautiful day or night ✌️
